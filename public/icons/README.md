# Placeholder Icons

This directory should contain your PWA icons in the following sizes:
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-512x512.png

You can create these icons using online tools like:
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator

For best results:
1. Use a chef hat or cooking pot icon
2. Use warm colors matching the theme (#8B4513 - Saddle Brown)
3. Ensure icons work as maskable icons (safe area in center)

Temporary placeholders will work, but custom icons are recommended for production.
